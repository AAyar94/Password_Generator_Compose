Password Generator app; **Dagger Hilt**, **LiveData**, **ViewModel**, based on **MVVM** Architecture.

## Architecture üèõ

**Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM)** is the industry recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application

- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -> ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- [ROOM Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) ->Room is a powerful and widely used database library in Android that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making it easier for developers to work with databases by defining data models as annotated Java or Kotlin objects and generating database code.
